# 999
A deck skin and three jokers based on the Zero Escape game "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine doors"

# Phase10
A single joker that adds Phase 10's "runs" as valid hands - scoring the same as their "set" counterparts (10-9-8 scoring as a 3oak).  It also changes the hand text to match the "runs" and "sets".  Probably still buggy

# Pockettes
A set of ten jokers, nine of which are based on canonically-tiny female characters.  The last joker synergizes with their size, allowing them to not take up any joker slots.

# Rot8er's Recipes
A few fusions that I am surprised do not already exist.
