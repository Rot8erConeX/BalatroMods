# 999
based on the Zero Escape game *Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors*

This mod is a deck skin for Clubs where each numbered card is replaced with the character whose bracelet number matches that number (with the character whose bracelet is 1 appearing on the 10 card).  Clubs were chosen due to the blue used by the high-contrast mode, being very similar to the LEDs on the bracelets.
There are also two (eventually three) jokers based on the game's events.  How the jokers interact with the game is affected by your deck skin - but why this is the case, is spoilers.

# Phase10
A single joker that adds Phase 10's "runs" as valid hands - scoring the same as their "set" counterparts (10-9-8 scoring as a 3oak).  It also changes the hand text to match the "runs" and "sets".  Probably still buggy

# Pockettes
A set of ten jokers, nine of which are based on canonically-tiny female characters.  The last joker synergizes with their size, allowing them to not take up any joker slots.

# Rot8er's Recipes
A few fusions that I am surprised do not already exist.
