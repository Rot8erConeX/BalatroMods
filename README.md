# 999
based on the Zero Escape game *Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors*

This mod is a deck skin for Clubs where each numbered card is replaced with the character whose bracelet number matches that number (with the character whose bracelet is 1 appearing on the 10 card).  Clubs were chosen due to the blue used by the high-contrast mode, being very similar to the LEDs on the bracelets.
There are also three jokers based on the game's events.  How two of the jokers interact with the game is affected by your deck skin - but why this is the case, is spoilers.

# Phase10
Probably the mod with the most potential for bugs.  Introduces a joker that allows Phase 10's "Runs" concept (a series of sequential numbers), to be valid scoring hands and for those to be scored the same as a "set" of the same size - for example, playing 10-9-8 will score the same as a Three of a Kind.  (yes this does mean that a Straight suddenly scores as a Five of a Kind).

When you have this joker, Pairs and -of-a-Kind hands will display as "Run of #" and "Set of #" to show how you met the criteria.

~~You cannot get a Full House with runs~~

# Pockettes
A series of ten jokers, nine of which are based on canonically-tiny female characters, with mechanics based on those characters' personalities or stories.

The last joker, the Collector's Dollhouse, synergizes with the ladies' size, allowing any of the other jokers next to the dollhouse to not take up any joker slots.

~~Mod devs should see this mod's README to make sure that Lily Enstomach properly buffs their jokers when she is eaten~~

# Rot8er's Recipes
A few fusions that I am surprised do not already exist.

If you have [FusionJokers](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1227317656131211284) installed but do *not* have [DeFused](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1271500476457812120) installed, these jokers will be given the Fusion rarity.  Otherwise, they will be added to the normal pool, at one rarity higher than the rarer of the two jokers required for the fusion.
