# 999
A deck skin and three jokers based on the Zero Escape game "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine doors".  The deck skin should be fine for people who have not played the game, as should the one joker that's not locked by default.  The other two jokers delve into heavy spoilers, but are also cryptic in their descriptions.

# Phase10
A single joker that adds Phase 10's "runs" as valid hands - scoring the same as their "set" counterparts (10-9-8 scoring as a 3oak).  It also changes the hand text to match the "runs" and "sets".  Probably still buggy

# Pockettes
A set of ten jokers, nine of which are based on canonically-tiny female characters.  The last joker synergizes with their size, allowing them to not take up any joker slots.

# Rot8er's Recipes
A few fusions that I am surprised do not already exist.
