# 999
based on the Zero Escape game *Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors*

This mod is a deck skin for Clubs where each numbered card is replaced with the character whose bracelet number matches that number (with the character whose bracelet is 1 appearing on the 10 card).  Clubs were chosen due to the blue used by the high-contrast mode, being very similar to the LEDs on the bracelets.
There are also two (eventually three) jokers based on the game's events.  How the jokers interact with the game is affected by your deck skin - but why this is the case, is spoilers.

# Phase10
Probably the mod with the most potential for bugs.  Introduces a joker that allows Phase 10's "Runs" concept (a series of sequential numbers), to be valid scoring hands and for those to be scored the same as a "set" of the same size - for example, playing 10-9-8 will score the same as a Three of a Kind.  (yes this does mean that a Straight suddenly scores as a Five of a Kind).

When you have this joker, Pairs and -of-a-Kind hands will display as "Run of #" and "Set of #" to show how you met the criteria.

~~You cannot get a Full House with runs~~

# Pockettes
A set of ten jokers, nine of which are based on canonically-tiny female characters.  The last joker synergizes with their size, allowing them to not take up any joker slots.

# Rot8er's Recipes
A few fusions that I am surprised do not already exist.
